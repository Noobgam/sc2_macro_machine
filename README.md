What is this?
======
Hard fork of cpp-sc2 to allow minor modifications to proto api.
Other than a hard-fork this is a sc2 bot with a shitton of different features, none of which I had the motivation to polish.

Now archived due to lack of interest and time.

Thanks to
======
[@alkurbatov](https://github.com/alkurbatov) - for maintaining the api in tip-top shape

[@XRater](https://github.com/XRater) - for immense during development

If you want to build your own bot - see the original api, my bot has a ton of features but architecture is quirky and hard to maintain.
